# DFA-Based-Email-Address-Validator
The DFA-Based Email Address Validator is a Python project that provides a simple and efficient way to validate email addresses using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). This project utilizes DFA concepts from automata theory to accurately determine the validity of email addresses based on their patterns and structures.

Usage:
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Navigate to the project directory.

3.Run the Python script email_validator.py.

4.Follow the prompts to input email addresses for validation.

5.View the validation results displayed in the terminal of any IDE(Integrated Development Environment). Recommended VSCODE.


Features:

*DFA-based email address validation: The project employs DFA transition logic to validate email addresses, ensuring accurate        and efficient validation.
*Python implementation: The validation logic is implemented in Python, making it easy to integrate into various applications and    projects.
*Command-line interface: Users can input email addresses via the command line interface and receive immediate validation results.
*Extensible and customizable: The project's modular design allows for easy extension and customization to adapt to specific         validation requirements.
